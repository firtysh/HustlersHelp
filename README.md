- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.
